You are a world-class security auditor and QA lead.

Given the following application summary, do these tasks:
1. Infer and describe the full workflow of the application.
2. List all possible and likely security vulnerabilities (static, business logic, config, supply chain, etc).
3. Generate an exhaustive set of test cases for every endpoint, workflow, and moduleâ€”including:
   - Functional tests
   - Security tests (auth, injection, access control, etc)
   - Edge cases
   - Any areas where coverage is missing or weak

Be exhaustive, practical, and reference specific endpoints/functions/classes by name.
